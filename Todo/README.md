Todo
====

This sample demonstrates a Todo list application where the data is stored and accessed in a local SQLite database.

The app functionality is:

- View a list of tasks.
- Add a new item to the list of tasks.
- Set a task's status to 'completed'.

In all cases the tasks are stored in a local SQLite database.

For more information about the sample see [Working with a Local Database](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/working-with/databases/).

_Note_: This sample may not work on Xamarin Live Player due to dependency on SQLite.
